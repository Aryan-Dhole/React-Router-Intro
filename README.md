# React Router Basics — Day 69 🚏

This project is part of my **100+ day grind journey** to become a world-class product builder.  
On **Day 69**, I set up React Router for the first time to unlock multi-page navigation in React.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Home, Notes, About pages** — simple demo routes
- **NavBar with active links** — styled with `NavLink`
- **Programmatic navigation** — buttons that use `useNavigate` (redirect via code)
- **404 fallback** — custom Not Found page
- **TailwindCSS styling** — clean and responsive UI
